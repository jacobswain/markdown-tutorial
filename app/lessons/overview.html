                Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions used for indicating
                formatting in email and usenet posts. It was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, who wrote the first markdown-to-html
                converter in Perl, and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many
                languages.
